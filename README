# Project Title

CS219 Programming Project 2

## Description

This program takes in a text file containing assembly style commands and computes them. An output will be be displayed in the terminal window.

The following commands can be included in the text that loads into the program as shown below.

```
Operation Operand1 Operand2
```

ADD - Takes in two operands and adds them together
AND - Takes in two operands and does a bitwise AND
ASR = Takes in an operand and a shift value. Does arithmetic shifting right
LSR - Takes in an operand and a shift value. Does a logical shift right
LSL - Takes in an operand and a shift value. Does a logical shift left
NOT - Takes in an operand and inverts the value.
ORR - Takes in two operands and does a bitwise OR
SUB - Takes in two operands and subtracts them 
XOR - Takes in two operands and does a bitwise XOR

Adding S to the end of a command will cause the Z and N flags to be set.

The Z flag denotes a result is zero and a N flag denotes that it is negative.

### Executing program

In order to load a new file change the name for the following code found on line 23.

```
 //OPEN FILE
    std::ifstream file("Programming-Project-2.txt"); //opens the file
```

Make sure the file is in the same folder as the project.

Next, use the make command and then run main.o.
